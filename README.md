## Motivation

This repository contains a newly designed one-sided reconstruction algorithm based on so called central weighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions.

## Applications

Such reconstruction algorithms can for example be used to construct high-order Finite Volume schemes to solve systems of balance laws or conservation laws. Those arise from a variety of physical phenomena.
